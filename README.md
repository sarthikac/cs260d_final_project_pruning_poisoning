# Mitigating Backdoor Poisoning Using Data Summarization and Model Pruning

This repository contains the code and experiments for our CS260D final project: “Mitigating Backdoor Poisoning using Data Summarization and Model Pruning.”
We study whether lightweight, single-shot data summarization (coreset) methods combined with model pruning can mitigate backdoor poisoning attacks without requiring complex multi-stage poison detection.
